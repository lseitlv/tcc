    abstract-note = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems control and monitor industrial and critical infrastructure functions, such as electricity, gas, water, waste, railway, and traffic. Recent attacks on SCADA systems highlight the need of stronger SCADA security. It is important to analyze the security risks and develop appropriate security solutions to protect such systems. However, a key problem is the lack of proper modeling tools to evaluate the security of SCADA systems. As widely accepted in academic and industrial communities, it is impractical to conduct security experiments on live systems. A modeling simulation tool would enable the simulation of SCADA systems with the benefit of testing different attack and security solutions. This paper proposes a simulation tool for building SCADA simulations that supports the integration of external devices and applications. A key benefit of this tool is the ability to test the effect of attacks on real devices and applications, even though using a simulated environment. The paper further describes two case studies that demonstrate how the tool can be efficiently used to create SCADA simulations and perform malicious attacks.},

Due to the strong dependency, the robustness of a smart grid communication network against attack is of the utmost importance for the deployment of the smart grid. Notably, the large scale and autonomous features of a smart grid render its cyber security quite vulnerable to adversaries. In this article, we introduce several intelligent attacks and countermeasures in smart grid communication networks, which aim for maximal damage or benefits by taking advantage of the network structure as well as the protocol functionality. We adopt the percolation-based connectivity in statistic mechanics to quantitatively analyze the network robustness. If the attack and defense strategies are involved, the attack can be further smart and complicated. Consequently, a twoplayer zero-sum game is introduced between the adversary and the defender, and the outcome of the game equilibrium is used to evaluate the performance of defense mechanisms with different network configurations. This article therefore offers novel insights and comprehensive analysis on the cyber security of a smart grid.},

A scalable and pervasive communication infrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we present the background and motivation of communication infrastructures in smart grid systems. We also summarize major requirements that smart grid communications must meet. From the experience of several industrial trials on smart grid with communication infrastructures, we expect that the traditional carbon fuel based power plants can cooperate with emerging distributed renewable energy such as wind, solar, etc, to reduce the carbon fuel consumption and consequent green house gas such as carbon dioxide emission. The consumers can minimize their expense on energy by adjusting their intelligent home appliance operations to avoid the peak hours and utilize the renewable energy instead. We further explore the challenges for a communication infrastructure as the part of a complex smart grid system. Since a smart grid system might have over millions of consumers and devices, the demand of its reliability and security is extremely critical. Through a communication infrastructure, a smart grid can improve power reliability and quality to eliminate electricity blackout. Security is a challenging issue since the on-going smart grid systems facing increasing vulnerabilities as more and more automation, remote monitoring/controlling and supervision entities are interconnected.},

Most of these networked control systems that are not designed with security protection can be vulnerable to network attacks nowadays, so there is a growing demand of efficient and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the network infrastructure of industrial plants. In this paper, we present a multi-agent IDS architecture that is designed for decentralized intrusion detection and prevention control in large switched networks. An efficient and biologically inspired learning model is proposed for anomaly intrusion detection in the multi-agent IDS. The proposed model called ant colony clustering model (ACCM) improves the existing ant-based clustering approach in searching for near-optimal clustering heuristically, in which meta-heuristics engages the optimization principles in swarm intelligence. In order to alleviate the curse of dimensionality, four unsupervised feature extraction algorithms are applied and evaluated on their effectiveness to enhance the clustering solution. The experimental results on KDD-Cup99 IDS benchmark data demonstrate that applying ACCM with one of the feature extraction algorithms is effective to detect known or unseen intrusion attacks with high detection rate and recognize normal network traffic with low false positive rate.},

For these specific purposes, several protocols has been designed to ensure the control and supervision operations. Modbus and DNP3 are the most used protocols in the ICS world due to their compliance with real time needs. With the increasing of the connectivity to the internet world for business reasons, ICS adopted Internet based technologies and most of communication protocols are redesigned to work over IP. This openness exposed the ICS components as well as communication protocols to cyber-attacks with a higher risk than attacks on traditional IT systems. In order to facilitate the risk assessment of cyber-attacks on ICS protocols we propose a taxonomy model of different identified attacks on Modbus and DNP3.the model is based on the threat origin, threat type, attack type, attack scenario, vulnerability type and the impact of the attack. We populate this Taxonomy model with identified attacks on Modbus and DNP3 from previous academic and industrial works.},

In RTCS_PROFIBUS, users can monitor the real-time data which is running in real-time operating system xPC Target and devices of PROFIBUS through LabVIEW user control program in Host PC. The communication between Host PC and Target PC is based on TCP/IP protocol through twisted-pair. The real-time data between xPC Target and controlled devices are transmitted by PROFIBUS through high-speed interface DPRAM. Furthermore, a communication mechanism is defined in order to create a mapping relation between data exchange area for user application and memory mapping area of DPRAM. RTCS_PROFIBUS implements the real-time data communication from LabVIEW user control program to xPC Target and the real-time data communication from xPC Target to PROFIBUS. RTCS_PROFIBUS has been applied to monitoring the motor running parameters in a real industrial control system. The run result proves that RTCS_PROFIBUS can satisfy the requirement of real-time and accuracy of data transfer.},

abstract={Increased complexity and interconnectivity of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in Smart Grids potentially means greater susceptibility to malicious attackers. SCADA systems with legacy communication infrastructure have inherent cyber-security vulnerabilities as these systems were originally designed with little consideration of cyber threats. In order to improve cyber-security of SCADA networks, this paper presents a rule-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) method, which includes signature-based and model-based approaches tailored for SCADA systems. The proposed signature-based rules can accurately detect several known suspicious or malicious attacks. In addition, model-based detection is proposed as a complementary method to detect unknown attacks. Finally, proposed intrusion detection approaches for SCADA networks are implemented and verified via Snort rules.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach for a next-generation SCADA-specific intrusion detection system (IDS). The proposed system analyzes multiple attributes in order to provide a comprehensive solution that is able to mitigate varied cyber-attack threats. The multiattribute IDS comprises a heterogeneous white list and behavior-based concept in order to make SCADA cybersystems more secure. This paper also proposes a multilayer cyber-security framework based on IDS for protecting SCADA cybersecurity in smart grids without compromising the availability of normal data.

abstract={The vital role Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play in controlling the modern infrastructure; along with the rapid evolution of these systems have turned them into one of the most desired targets for malicious attackers. Moreover, SCADA-specific attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and yet security measures are deployed at a very slow pace. In this work, we present a SCADA-specific Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that detects SCADA attacks based on their network traffic behavior, namely the temporal behavior of frequent patterns of the SCADA protocols. The IDS raises alarms when abnormal behavior is identified. The results showed that the IDS is able to detect attacks at a high rate while keeping false alarms at a minimum rate.},

abstract={Smart grids provide bi-directional communication between smart meters at user premises and utility provider for the purpose of efficient energy management through Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Recent studies have shown that the potential threats targeting AMI are significant. Despite the need of developing intrusion detection systems (IDS) tailored for the smart grid [4], very limited progress has been made in this area so far. Unlike traditional networks, smart grid has its unique challenges, such as limited computational power devices and potentially high deployment cost, which restrict the deployment options of intrusion detectors. However, smart grid exhibits behavior that can be accurately modeled based on its configuration, which can be exploited to design efficient intrusion detectors. In this paper, we show that AMI behavior can be modeled using event logs collected at smart collectors, which in turn can be verified using the specifications invariant generated from the configurations of the AMI devices. We model the AMI behavior using the fourth order Markov chain and the stochastic model is then probabilistically verified using specifications written in Linear Temporal Logic. Our model is capable of detecting malicious behavior in the AMI network due to intrusions or device malfunctioning. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset of thousands of meters collected at the AMI of a leading utility provider.},

abstract={The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is a crucial component of the smart grid, replacing traditional analog devices with computerized smart meters. Smart meters have not only allowed for efficient management of many end-users, but also have made AMI an attractive target for remote exploits and local physical tampering with the end goal of stealing energy. While smart meters posses multiple sensors and data sources that can indicate energy theft, in practice, the individual methods exhibit many false positives. In this paper, we present AMIDS, an AMI intrusion detection system that uses information fusion to combine the sensors and consumption data from a smart meter to more accurately detect energy theft. AMIDS combines meter audit logs of physical and cyber events with consumption data to more accurately model and detect theft-related behavior. Our experimental results on normal and anomalous load profiles show that AMIDS can identify energy theft efforts with high accuracy. Furthermore, AMIDS correctly identified legitimate load profile changes that more elementary analyses classified as malicious.},
