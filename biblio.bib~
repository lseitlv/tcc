    abstract-note = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems control and monitor industrial and critical infrastructure functions, such as electricity, gas, water, waste, railway, and traffic. Recent attacks on SCADA systems highlight the need of stronger SCADA security. It is important to analyze the security risks and develop appropriate security solutions to protect such systems. However, a key problem is the lack of proper modeling tools to evaluate the security of SCADA systems. As widely accepted in academic and industrial communities, it is impractical to conduct security experiments on live systems. A modeling simulation tool would enable the simulation of SCADA systems with the benefit of testing different attack and security solutions. This paper proposes a simulation tool for building SCADA simulations that supports the integration of external devices and applications. A key benefit of this tool is the ability to test the effect of attacks on real devices and applications, even though using a simulated environment. The paper further describes two case studies that demonstrate how the tool can be efficiently used to create SCADA simulations and perform malicious attacks.},

Following a brief discussion about major challenges in smart grid development, we elaborate on smart grid cyber security issues. We define a taxonomy of basic cyber attacks, upon which sophisticated attack behaviors may be built. We then introduce fundamental security techniques, whose integration is essential for achieving full protection against existing and future sophisticated security attacks. By discussing some interesting open problems, we finally expect to trigger more research efforts in this emerging area.},

Con trary to initial belief, Stuxnet wasn't about industrial espionage: it didn't steal, manipulate, or erase information. Rather, Stuxnet's goal was to physically destroy a military target-not just meta phorically, but literally. Let's see how this was done.},

    abstract-note = {The operations of a smart grid heavily rely on the support of communication infrastructures for efficient electricity management and reliable power distribution. Due to the strong dependency, the robustness of a smart grid communication network against attack is of the utmost importance for the deployment of the smart grid. Notably, the large scale and autonomous features of a smart grid render its cyber security quite vulnerable to adversaries. In this article, we introduce several intelligent attacks and countermeasures in smart grid communication networks, which aim for maximal damage or benefits by taking advantage of the network structure as well as the protocol functionality. We adopt the percolation-based connectivity in statistic mechanics to quantitatively analyze the network robustness. If the attack and defense strategies are involved, the attack can be further smart and complicated. Consequently, a twoplayer zero-sum game is introduced between the adversary and the defender, and the outcome of the game equilibrium is used to evaluate the performance of defense mechanisms with different network configurations. This article therefore offers novel insights and comprehensive analysis on the cyber security of a smart grid.},

    abstract-note = {The operation and control of the next generation electrical grids will depend on a complex network of computers, software, and communication technologies. Being compromised by a malicious adversary would cause significant damage, including extended power outages and destruction of electrical equipment. Moreover, the implementation of the smart grid will include the deployment of many new enabling technologies such as advanced sensors and metering, and the integration of distributed generation resources. Such technologies and various others will require the addition and utilization of multiple communication mechanisms and infrastructures that may suffer from serious cyber vulnerabilities. These need to be addressed in order to increase the security and thus the greatest adoption and success of the smart grid. In this article, we focus on the communication security aspect, which deals with the distribution component of the smart grid. Consequently, we target the network security of the advanced metering infrastructure coupled with the data communication toward the transmission infrastructure. We discuss the security and feasibility aspects of possible communication mechanisms that could be adopted on that subpart of the grid. By accomplishing this, the correlated vulnerabilities in these systems could be remediated, and associated risks may be mitigated for the purpose of enhancing the cyber security of the future electric grid.},

A scalable and pervasive communication infrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we present the background and motivation of communication infrastructures in smart grid systems. We also summarize major requirements that smart grid communications must meet. From the experience of several industrial trials on smart grid with communication infrastructures, we expect that the traditional carbon fuel based power plants can cooperate with emerging distributed renewable energy such as wind, solar, etc, to reduce the carbon fuel consumption and consequent green house gas such as carbon dioxide emission. The consumers can minimize their expense on energy by adjusting their intelligent home appliance operations to avoid the peak hours and utilize the renewable energy instead. We further explore the challenges for a communication infrastructure as the part of a complex smart grid system. Since a smart grid system might have over millions of consumers and devices, the demand of its reliability and security is extremely critical. Through a communication infrastructure, a smart grid can improve power reliability and quality to eliminate electricity blackout. Security is a challenging issue since the on-going smart grid systems facing increasing vulnerabilities as more and more automation, remote monitoring/controlling and supervision entities are interconnected.},
